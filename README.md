# TransformRobustness


This is the repository of my master thesis "On the Sesitivity and Uncertainty of Convolution Neural Networks to Adversarial Perturbations". 
You can read the thesis here : [paper](https://github.com/senad96/TransformRobustness/blob/main/Master_Thesis_.pdf).

Here [presentation](https://github.com/senad96/TransformRobustness/blob/main/presentation_master_thesis.pdf) you can read the paper. Code will be available asap.
